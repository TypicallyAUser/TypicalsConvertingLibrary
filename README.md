# TypicalsConvertingLibrary
a nice converting lib (that u can use for reanimations too btw!)

# Docs

lib.Noclip(instance) - puts noclip on anything

lib.GetHatData(hatid, false or true) - returns the size and name of the hat | false is no notification, true is notification

lib.ReanimationRigGet() - returns the reanimation rig instance for compatibility with all reanimations

lib.LoadLibraryFix() - fixes the load library inside of your convert/script

lib.Notification(title, text, icon, duration) - makes a notification, good for reanimations or scripts

lib.Net() -- executes my net | supports most exploits

lib.FindHat(Name, Size) - finds the hat with the hat or size, size isnt needed | can be used with lib.GetHatData as so, GetHatData[1] for name

lib.Align(Part0, Part1, Position, Angle) - mostly no delay alignement | has velocity built in

lib.Align2(Part0, Part1, Position, Angle) - same thing as Align1 but without velocity built in
